# Lung cancer classification

## Problem 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, resulting in the highest mortality rates among men and women. 
With an estimated 1.8 million deaths in 2020, lung cancer's high fatality rate is driven in large part by late diagnosis, as symptoms often appear only in advanced stages when treatment options are limited. 
Smoking is the primary cause, responsible for around 85% of cases, yet environmental factors like secondhand smoke, pollution, and occupational hazards also contribute significantly.    

Early detection is crucial, as it can greatly improve survival rates by getting help as early as possible.
Despite the availability of screening techniques, only high-risk individuals are typically screened. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts lung cancer, offering a tool that could assist in early detection.

## Solution

### Data
For this project I will be using a data set from Kaggle called "Lung cancer data", which has around 16 attributes, and it's also labeled.   
I am a bit sceptical about this data, since I couldn't find any information about this source.

### Model
Classification is probably the best solution based on the data and makes most sense, since the goal is to predict whether a person has lung cancer or not.
